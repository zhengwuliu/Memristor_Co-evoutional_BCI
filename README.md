# Memristor_Co-evoutional_BCI
This code repository supports implementing the one-step decoder described in the manuscript 'A memristor chip-based adaptive neuromorphic decoder for co-evolutional brain-computer interfaces'.

## Requirements:
- MATLAB 2023

## Getting Started
To run the code, please execute the script `main.m` with Matlab.

## Main file descriptions
`b.mat`, `Wfea.mat` and `template.mat` are temporal filter, spatial filter, and brain signal template, respectively.
